        <p>Aleks Le is an actor & voice actor based in Los Angeles, California. Moving to the United States from Asia at
            the age of 10, Aleks had no concept of the English language. He used cartoons and video games to help him

            works such as Dragon Ball Super, Vinland Saga, PokÃ©mon, Astral Chain, Dorohedoro, and Call of Duty. As an
            Asian immigrant, Aleks brings his unique history and experiences to all projects he works on, including his
            work voicing a Southeast Asian character in the Cartoon Network series Craig of the Creek. He is proud of
            his heritage and hopes to continue to represent it in his future work.When he's not voice acting, Aleks
